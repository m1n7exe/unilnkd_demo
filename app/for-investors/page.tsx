          Unlinkd is a next-generation mentorship and admissions-support platform
          dedicated to empowering students during one of the most critical transitions 
          of their academic journey. Founded on the belief that informed decisions 
          drive better outcomes, we connect students with qualified mentors who can 
          offer accurate, experience-based guidance.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Today’s students often navigate university admissions with limited information 
          and unequal access to support networks. Unlinkd addresses this gap by providing 
          a structured, credible, and scalable model of mentorship. Our platform ensures 
          quality through mentor verification, guided session structures, and transparent pricing.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">Our Mission</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          To revolutionise the digital mentorship landscape by making expert guidance affordable, 
          accessible, and trustworthy for students navigating admissions, scholarships, 
          and early careers.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">Our Vision</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          To become the leading mentorship platform in Singapore and Southeast Asia,
          empowering millions of students to achieve their academic and professional aspirations.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">The Problem We Solve</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Every year, thousands of students navigate university admissions and scholarship applications 
          with insufficient support. Reliable mentorship usually depends on personal networks, which 
          many students do not have. Existing solutions — tuition centres, agencies, or free online 
          resources — are often expensive, inconsistent in quality, or not personalised.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          This creates a structural gap where students need trustworthy, experience-based guidance but 
          lack accessible and affordable avenues to obtain it.
